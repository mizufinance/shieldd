# IBC Protocol Implementation

Shieldd supports the [IBC protocol](https://ibcprotocol.org/) for
interoperating with other counterparty blockchains. Unlike most blockchains that currently deploy IBC, Shieldd is not based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). IBC as a protocol supports replication of data between two communicating blockchains. It provides basic building blocks for building higher-level cross chain applications, as well as a protocol specification for the most commonly used IBC applications, the [ICS-20 transfer](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer) protocol.

Shieldd implements the core IBC protocol building blocks: [ICS-23 compatible state inclusion proofs](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/core/ics-023-vector-commitments), [connections](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/core/ics-003-connection-semantics) as well as [channels and packets](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics).

## IBC Actions

Shieldd exposes one relay-oriented IBC action, `IbcRelay`, which carries the
IBC datagrams needed to advance clients, connections, channels, and packets:

### ICS-003 Connections

* `ConnOpenInit`
* `ConnOpenTry`
* `ConnOpenAck`
* `ConnOpenConfirm`

### ICS-004 Channels and Packets

* `ChanOpenInit`
* `ChanOpenTry`
* `ChanOpenAck`
* `ChanOpenConfirm`
* `ChanCloseInit`
* `ChanCloseConfirm`
* `RecvPacket`
* `Timeout`
* `Acknowledgement`

These datagrams are implemented as protocol buffers, with `IbcRelay` using a
protobuf `oneof` to encapsulate the supported relay payloads.

# Transfers into Shieldd

IBC transfer mechanics are specified in [ICS20]. The
[`FungibleTokenPacketData`][ftpd] packet describes the transfer:
```
FungibleTokenPacketData {
    denomination: string,
    amount: uint256,
    sender: string,
    receiver: string,
}
```

The `sender` and `receiver` fields are used to specify the sending account on
the source chain and the receiving account on the destination chain. However,
for inbound transfers, the destination chain is Shieldd, which has no
accounts. Instead, token transfers into Shieldd are decoded into a shielded
note owned by the destination address embedded in the packet payload.

Outbound transfers use the dedicated `ShieldedIcs20Withdrawal` action, which
consumes shielded inputs, binds the resulting ICS-20 withdrawal effect, and may
emit a sender-owned shielded change note.

## Handling Bridged Assets 

Shieldd's native state model uses notes, which contain an amount of a
particular asset. Amounts in Shieldd are 128-bit unsigned integers, in order
to support assets which have potentially large base denoms (such as Ethereum).
When receiving an IBC transfer, if the amount being transferred is greater than
`u128`, we return an error.
