# Compliance Flow

Shieldd compliance gives issuers selective visibility into regulated-asset
activity while leaving unregulated assets on the normal private path. The chain
still validates asset integrity with Shieldd circuits; Orbis/ACP/Defra are
confidentiality and authorization services, not balance-integrity authorities.

External systems:

- **Orbis**: MPC ring key, encrypted-seed storage, and PRE for authorized audit.
- **Defra**: off-chain KYC document storage.
- **SourceHub**: ACP policies, Orbis `x/orbis` records, and Defra proof verification.

For low-level formats, schema, and source files, see `reference.md`.

## Registration

1. **Ring creation**: issuer creates SourceHub policy metadata, authorizes the
   Orbis nodes for that policy, creates a SourceHub `x/orbis` ring from Orbis
   node keys, then starts DKG against that `ring_id`.

```text
Orbis nodes -> NodeInfo(node_key, peer_id, controller_key)
Issuer/controller -> ACP policy
Issuer/controller -> UpdateNodePeerId(node_key, docker-reachable peer_id)
Issuer/controller -> AddNodeToWhitelist(node_key, policy_id)
Issuer/controller -> CreateRing(peer_node_keys, threshold, policy_id) -> ring_id
Issuer -> Orbis DKG(ring_id)
  -> Orbis finalizes x/orbis Ring(ring_id, ring_pk)
  -> ring_id and ring_pk public on Shieldd
  -> sk_ring threshold-shared inside Orbis
```

Orbis node keys are stable chain identities. Peer IDs are network routes and may
be rewritten for Docker/local topology before they are written to each node's
SourceHub `NodeInfo`.

2. **Asset registration**: issuer submits `RegisterAsset` on Shieldd.

```text
AssetPolicy {
  dk_pub,
  ring_pk,
  threshold,
  slot_count,
  allowed_channels,
  ring_id,
  policy_id,
  permission,
  resource
}
```

Regulated assets are inserted into the indexed asset tree. Unregistered assets
are treated as unregulated through non-membership proofs. Channel whitelist
enforcement is first-hop only and immutable after registration.
The tree root is committed in app state; large node/leaf materialization lives
in NV storage and is checked at readiness.

3. **User registration**: user completes KYC with Defra, publishes a hidden-doc
   proof through SourceHub/Orbis, then registers a `(address, asset)` compliance
   leaf on Shieldd. ACP assigns or authorizes a slot for the asset and supplies
   canonical random slot derivation material.

```text
slot_id < AssetPolicy.slot_count
d   = SHA256("elgamal-derivation-v1\0\0" || slot_derivation)
ACK = d * ring_pk
```

Normal Shieldd address generation is unchanged. `slot_derivation` is opaque
canonical slot material, not an address diversifier. `ACK` means Audit
Compliance Key: it is the per-slot key used for audit-tier encryption. `d` and
`slot_derivation` are stored in the compliance leaf; `ACK` is derived from `d`
and the asset's `ring_pk`, but is not stored.

Reusing a slot for multiple registered addresses reuses the same
`slot_derivation`, `d`, and ACK, so those addresses are clusterable. This is
allowed for regulated assets, but docs and clients should recommend one
registered address per slot unless the user intentionally accepts that
clustering. v1 uses bounded slots per asset; later versions can raise the bound
or make it effectively unbounded.

`slot_id` is not an additional privacy boundary when the corresponding
`slot_derivation` is visible: the derivation material already defines the
linkable class. Making `slot_id` public only names that class and does not add
meaningful leakage beyond public registration data. Hiding `slot_id` would only
matter in a future design that also hides `slot_derivation` from the same
observer set.

## Transfer

Users run normal transfers:

```bash
pcli tx transfer --to <recipient> <amount><asset>
```

The planner detects regulated assets and adds the transfer compliance bundle.
Both sender and receiver must have compliance leaves for the regulated asset.

```text
planner:
  fetch sender/receiver compliance leaves
  fetch AssetPolicy
  derive sender/receiver ACKs from leaf d
  set is_flagged = amount >= threshold
  create one receiver-output compliance ciphertext
```

The receiver output carries a unified transfer compliance ciphertext and DLEQ
(Discrete Logarithm Equality) material for each audit tier. The DLEQ material is
for Orbis authorization-time binding: after ACP authorizes access to a specific
policy/resource/permission/tier/timestamp tuple, Orbis verifies that the
requested ciphertext was encrypted under matching metadata before running PRE.
Inputs and change outputs carry no compliance ciphertext.

| Tier | Content | Unflagged Encryption | Flagged Encryption |
|------|---------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Detection | asset id, flag, salt, sender slot id, receiver slot id | `dk_pub` | `dk_pub` |
| Sender core | amount | sender ACK | `dk_pub` |
| Sender ext | receiver address | sender ACK | `dk_pub` |
| Output core | amount | receiver ACK | `dk_pub` |
| Output ext | sender address | receiver ACK | `dk_pub` |

`dk_pub` is the issuer Detection Key public key from `AssetPolicy`. Detection
is always issuer-DK decryptable and carries the slot ids needed to select the
one slot derivation for PRE. The slot ids may also be public without extra
privacy loss, because the registered `slot_derivation` already reveals same-slot
clustering. ACK encryption routes unflagged audit tiers to authorized
subject/ring access through Orbis PRE; flagged transfers encrypt all audit tiers
to issuer `dk_pub` directly. Core tiers carry values such as amount; extension
tiers carry address/counterparty data so authorization can separate value access
from address metadata access.

The transfer circuit owns value/nullifier/note/balance soundness. Compliance
owns asset-policy binding, threshold flag correctness, ciphertext construction,
detection tag correctness, tier metadata, and DLEQ validity. The DLEQ does not
protect Shieldd balances or nullifiers; it is in the transaction proof because
the transaction sender is adversarial. Accepted transactions must carry valid
DLEQ material so the issuer and Orbis can later rely on it when ACP authorizes
PRE for a specific metadata tuple. See:

- `docs/compliance/constraint-checklist.md`
- `docs/transfer-circuit/constraint-checklist.md`

## Scanner And Audit Pipeline

The scanner DB is the spine. It is not a stage. Scanning, screening, evidence
validation, decryption, audit projection, and exporters all share keyed rows.

```text
Chain
  -> Scan: extract raw OutputRef ciphertexts and clear public flows
  -> Scanner DB spine
  -> Screen: detection-tier DK decrypt marks detected / irrelevant / invalid
  -> Validate evidence: persisted ciphertext + upload bundle + policy/ring binding
  -> Decrypt audit tiers per detected output:
       flagged:   full-tier issuer DK decrypt
       unflagged: Orbis PRE decrypt
  -> Audit ledger projection
  -> Exporters: audit-demo JSON, reports, Orbis audit input
```

`ComplianceScreener` is pure. It parses transfer ciphertexts and DK-decrypts the
detection tier only. It does not persist, fetch blocks, call Orbis, consult ACP,
or mutate audit state.

An upload bundle is the client-produced set of per-tier encrypted-seed upload
packages: encrypted seed material, tier metadata, policy/ring binding, and
proofs needed by Orbis storage/PRE. "Encrypted-seed upload package" refers to
one tier inside the bundle. See `reference.md` for the canonical fields.

Current Orbis storage no longer uses a Shieldd-facing bulletin namespace.
`StoreSecret` posts a SourceHub-backed Orbis document record and returns its
`object_id`; the record binds the encrypted document, proof, `ring_id`,
`policy_id`, `resource`, `permission`, optional tier, and optional timestamp.
PRE later reads that document by `object_id`, reads the ring by `ring_id`, checks
ACP authorization against the document policy metadata, and returns the
re-encrypted tier seed.

```text
ExtractedComplianceCiphertext
  -> Irrelevant
  -> Detected(DetectionEvent)
  -> InvalidCiphertext
```

The scanner is reorg-safe: each block row stores `height`, `block_hash`, and
`parent_hash`. A parent mismatch rolls back to the common ancestor and replays.
Invalid ciphertext persistence is capped per block.

```bash
pcli tx compliance scan run \
  --node <url> \
  --db /path/to/compliance-scanner.db \
  --dk-hex <hex> \
  --scan-asset-id <id>

pcli tx compliance scan catch-up \
  --node <url> \
  --db /path/to/compliance-scanner.db \
  --dk-hex <hex> \
  --scan-asset-id <id>
```

## Audit Branches

Detected private rows start as `pending`. Audit completion requires validated
evidence first.

```text
pending -> evidence_valid
pending -> evidence_invalid
evidence_invalid -> evidence_valid
evidence_valid -> decrypt_failed
decrypt_failed -> audit_complete
evidence_valid -> audit_complete
audit_complete -> audit_complete
```

Forbidden:

```text
pending -> audit_complete
evidence_invalid -> audit_complete
```

### Flagged

If `amount >= threshold`, all tiers are encrypted to `dk_pub`. The issuer can
decrypt locally after evidence validates. Orbis is not used.

### Unflagged

Only the detection tier decrypts locally. It includes sender and receiver slot
ids, so audit can run PRE against the selected slot key instead of trying every
registered address. Audit tiers require governance/ACP authorization and Orbis
PRE. Each tier has an independent encrypted-seed upload package and independent
PRE path.

```text
ACP grant
  -> Orbis reads stored encrypted-seed object and ring metadata
  -> Orbis checks ACP against policy/resource/permission/tier/timestamp
  -> Orbis verifies the ciphertext/proof binds to the authorized metadata
  -> issuer requests PRE for authorized tier object_id
  -> issuer recovers tier seed
  -> issuer decrypts Shieldd tier payload locally
```

Audit-demo and reports are exporters over the scanner DB. The frontend state
shape remains `scan`, `scanner`, `ledgerRows`, and `audits`; backend state comes
from the DB.
