# Compliance Flow

Shieldd, embedded inside Bankd, gives issuers selective visibility into regulated-asset
transfers while preserving the same fixed circuit shape for unregulated
assets. Ledger safety remains a Bankd consensus and Shieldd circuit responsibility.
External policy systems do not authorize spends or establish balance
conservation.

The current transfer surface deliberately excludes PRE envelopes, DLEQ
proofs, DH shared points, and any other seed-opening material. Orbis v0 remains
useful for ring and policy registration, but its audit export/import path is
disabled until a non-disclosing PRE v1 exists.

For exact encodings and statement order, see `reference.md`.

## Registration

An issuer creates its policy and ring configuration, then registers an
`AssetPolicy` on Shieldd:

```text
AssetPolicy {
  dk_pub,
  ring_pk,
  threshold,
  allowed_ibc_routes,
  ibc_origin,
  ring_id,
  policy_id,
  permission,
  resource
}
```

Regulated assets are members of the indexed asset tree. An unregistered asset
is proved unregulated with a valid non-membership gap. The asset proof must use
the current mutable policy root. User compliance proofs must use the exact
current mutable user tree because each leaf also commits authorization status.

Policy admission rejects identity `dk_pub` and `ring_pk` values before
registration can mutate durable state. This prevents a regulated asset from
selecting a degenerate detection or audit key even if its membership witness is
otherwise valid.

A user registers a `(shielded address, asset)` compliance leaf:

```text
d   = SHA512("elgamal-derivation-v1\0\0" || canonical_address_bytes) reduced mod Fr
ACK = d * ring_pk
```

The version-5 leaf commits to the address diversified-generator encoding,
transmission-key encoding, asset id, canonical address-derived `d`, and the
per-user/per-asset status. Registration checks the complete five-field
commitment, address encoding, derivation, and authorization. A derived `d = 0`
is rejected rather than registering the identity ACK. There is no issuer-
assigned slot or caller-selected derivation material.

Asset id zero is reserved for the indexed-tree sentinel. Registration and both
Transfer and Withdrawal circuits reject it as an action asset, so the sentinel
cannot be presented as an authenticated regulated policy.

## Transfer Construction

The circuit excludes the Decaf identity class for the authorization key and
both distinct address generators: the shared sender generator and the receiver
generator. Each is an exact `x != 0` row, matching the native full-viewing-key
and address gadgets. These are ownership constraints, not builder hygiene:
identity sender DTK derivation would make the transmission key independent of
the IVK and let one note commitment/path be reopened under distinct nullifier
keys, while an identity receiver generator would let a malicious proof create
such a note.

The transfer planner selects one policy shape:

- Regulated: exact asset-tree membership, registered sender and receiver
  compliance leaves, and the registered policy values.
- Unregulated: exact asset-tree non-membership, fixed sink ring/DK points,
  and the canonical hash of the empty string for each policy identifier. The
  authenticated gap-predecessor threshold remains present in the leaf witness,
  but it cannot affect the regulation-gated flag.

Both branches construct the same detection and audit ciphertext rows. The
encryption equations are unconditional; `is_regulated` selects the effective
keys and policy hashes and gates the authenticated-leaf threshold result rather
than bypassing encryption checks.

The circuit computes
`is_flagged = is_regulated * (amount >= authenticated_leaf_threshold)`. A
regulated transfer is therefore flagged exactly at and above its registered
threshold; an unregulated transfer is never flagged, regardless of the
authenticated predecessor leaf's threshold or the receiver amount.

| Tier | Plaintext | Unflagged regulated key | Flagged regulated key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Detection | asset id; salt; flag; reserved zero | issuer `dk_pub` | issuer `dk_pub` |
| Sender core | amount | sender ACK | issuer `dk_pub` |
| Sender extension | receiver address | sender ACK | issuer `dk_pub` |
| Output core | amount | receiver ACK | issuer `dk_pub` |
| Output extension | sender address | receiver ACK | issuer `dk_pub` |

Unregulated transfers use the selected sink policy. Its ciphertexts remain
well-formed, but no issuer decryptability or PRE audit capability is claimed.

The four detection plaintext words are exact:

```text
asset_id
detection_salt
is_flagged
0
```

The flag is constrained to a canonical bit and the final word is constrained
to zero. Address candidate filtering uses the separate proof-bound routing
tags, not detection plaintext.

Honest construction samples a fresh private CSPRNG nonce root for each
Transfer action, separate from every sibling Transfer and fee-funding action.
All five salts and the tier seeds/randomizers are deterministically
domain-separated from that root. Reusing one root would repeat EPK and stream
material. Root freshness is a native privacy premise, not a circuit or
consensus check, because the root is private and a malicious creator controls
its own randomness. Each derived tier scalar is rejection-sampled until
nonzero, preventing an identity EPK/shared secret from exposing an honestly
constructed tier.

Only the receiver output carries compliance data:

```text
TransferOutputBody {
  compliance_ciphertext: 640 bytes
  compliance_metadata:   264 bytes
}
```

Inputs and the change output carry neither field. The metadata is a single
factored record:

```text
ring_id_hash
policy_id_hash
resource_hash
permission_hash
target_timestamp
sender_core_salt
sender_ext_salt
output_core_salt
output_ext_salt
```

The circuit binds every metadata value to its selected policy or witness fact.
Tier identity is structural: the four EPK/c2/ciphertext groups and four salts
always occur in sender-core, sender-extension, output-core, output-extension
order.

## Consensus And Proof Boundary

The transfer circuit proves:

- fixed two-input/two-output shape and dummy-slot semantics;
- spend ownership, authorization-key randomization, membership, nullifiers,
  note commitments, value conservation, and balance commitment;
- non-identity authorization key and sender/receiver diversified generators;
- asset membership versus canonical non-membership gap;
- rejection of the asset-tree zero sentinel;
- regulated policy selection and compliance-leaf membership;
- complete version-5 compliance leaves and `Active` sender/receiver status;
- threshold flag correctness;
- four independent EPK/shared-secret/c2/payload encryption relations;
- detection encryption;
- exact asset/salt/boolean-flag/reserved-zero detection plaintext;
- two proof-derived, privately permuted 32-bit routing tags and their complete
  parameter-set identifier;
- the consensus recent-position floor and, for each spend, the exact old-note
  classification `!is_dummy && position < recent_position_floor`;
- canonical address plaintext packing from the two 32-byte Fq encodings into
  31-byte stream words;
- the single 9-field metadata binding; and
- the exact 45-field statement preimage committed under statement-hash domain
  `v7`.

The Rust verifier reconstructs the same 45 fields from typed public data.
Consensus separately checks proof verification, the current asset-policy and
user-status roots, timestamp freshness, spend signatures,
transaction-wide nullifier uniqueness, and the
binding signature. Transfer's effect hash includes the exact receiver
ciphertext and metadata, so a delegated builder cannot replace encryption
randomness or payload bytes after the spends are authorized.

## Scanner And Evidence

The scanner extracts only typed public facts:

```text
ExtractedComplianceCiphertext {
  output_ref,
  routing_tags: [u32; 2],
  raw_bytes,
  metadata_bytes
}
```

The scanner DB is the durable spine:

```text
chain output
  -> canonical ciphertext/metadata decode
  -> detection-tier DK screening
  -> persisted detection or bounded invalid row
  -> canonical evidence validation
  -> flagged issuer-DK tier decryption
  -> audit ledger projection
```

`ComplianceScreener` is pure parsing plus detection-key screening. It performs
no persistence, chain fetches, ACP decisions, or PRE calls. Scanner blocks are
keyed by height/hash/parent hash; a reorg rolls state back to the common
ancestor before replay.

Evidence version 3 contains the output reference, asset/flag/detection facts,
the 640-byte ciphertext, the 264-byte metadata record, and a payload hash. It
contains no PRE envelope, shared point, or standalone DLEQ proof. Evidence
validation compares both ciphertext and metadata to the accepted output and
the persisted detection row before an audit can complete.

Valid audit transitions are:

```text
pending -> evidence_valid | evidence_invalid
evidence_valid -> evidence_invalid | decrypt_failed | audit_complete
evidence_invalid -> evidence_valid
decrypt_failed -> audit_complete
audit_complete -> audit_complete
```

## Audit Availability

Flagged regulated transfers encrypt every audit tier to the issuer DK. After
evidence validation, the issuer can decrypt them locally and complete the
audit.

Unflagged regulated tiers encrypt to the sender or receiver ACK. The former
Orbis v0 path would disclose the seed-opening DH point, so both
`export_orbis_pending_scan` and `import_orbis_audit_entries` fail closed. An
unflagged row therefore cannot currently complete through PRE.

This is an intentional availability restriction, not a confidentiality
exception. A future PRE v1 must provide a non-disclosing, circuit-bound seed
ciphertext and new formal evidence before the export/import path is enabled.
The generic DLEQ Lean and symbolic models remain research artifacts only; they
are not evidence for the deployed transfer.
