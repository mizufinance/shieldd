# Code and documentation map

Runtime code and protocol records define the current implementation. Read only
the area relevant to the task; each topic has one authoritative document.

Formal specifications and certification evidence live in
[shieldd-security](https://github.com/mizufinance/shieldd-security), pinned to an
exact Shieldd commit. Their gates are separate from this repository’s tests.
