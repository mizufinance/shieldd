# Protocol reference

This page describes current Shieldd records. Exact field ordering and encodings
live in the linked code and schemas; cryptographic relations also have independent
Rust/Go vectors. Internal format policy is in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Keys and addresses

[BIP44 derivation](../crates/core/keys/src/keys/bip44.rs) uses
`m/44'/6532'/account'`. The spend seed derives spend authorization and nullifier
keys. Full viewing keys contain the spend verification key and nullifier key;
incoming viewing keys scan incoming notes, and outgoing viewing keys recover
sent-note data. Proving can be delegated without giving the builder signing keys.
Key constructors enforce the current nonzero/nonidentity refinements.

[Addresses](../crates/core/keys/src/address.rs) contain a 16-byte diversifier and
32-byte canonical transmission key. The 48-byte payload is F4Jumbled and Bech32m
encoded. Diversifiers are AES-derived from address indices; the diversified
basepoint uses the `Shieldd_Divrsfy` domain, and the transmission key is
`ivk * B_d`. There is no separate discovery key in the address. Exact key KDF
labels and rejection rules live in [keys](../crates/core/keys/src/keys).
[Routing](routing.md) describes selector derivation and remote-provider leakage.

## Assets, notes and nullifiers

An amount is a `u128`; a value pairs it with a canonical asset ID. Asset IDs are
field-valued hashes of canonical denominations, distinct from IBC’s SHA-256
trace identifier. Use [asset derivation](../crates/core/asset/src/asset/id.rs),
including its vectors, rather than deriving identifiers in callers. Base-asset
fees consist of the required gas charge and any excess tip.

A [note](../crates/core/component/shielded-pool/src/note.rs) contains a value,
address, random seed and recovery commitment. Its commitment uses Poseidon
`hash_6` under `Fq(BLAKE2b-512("shieldd.notecommit"))`, with ordered inputs:

```text
note blinding, amount, asset ID,
compressed diversified generator, transmission-key field, recovery commitment
```

The blinding derives from the seed under `Shieldd_DeriRcm`. Commitment-to-address
checks use the canonical diversified generator and transmission key. Note
ciphertexts use the note encryption implementation’s authenticated encoding;
recovery capsules have a separate proved relation described in
[enforcement and seizure](compliance/enforcement-and-seizure.md).

A [positioned nullifier](../crates/core/component/sct/src/nullifier.rs) is
`hash_3(Fq(BLAKE2b-512("shieldd.nullifier")), (nk, commitment, position))`.
Regulated actions use the effective compliance-scoped nullifier key selected by
the proved policy relation. Consensus rejects duplicate/spent nullifiers.
[Nullifier history](nullifier-history.md) defines current/previous generations,
archived nonmembership proofs, and activation/pruning requirements.

The tiered commitment tree preserves ordered positions, height-aware hash domains
and finalized padding. Validators can forget witnesses; wallets retain owned-note
witnesses. [State](state.md) defines batched materialization and storage invariants.

## Transactions and signing

A [transaction plan](../crates/core/transaction/src/plan.rs) exposes intended
effects for authorization. Proof construction fills action proofs; authorization
assembly adds spend signatures and the transaction binding signature.

[Effect hashes](../crates/core/txhash/src/effect_hash.rs) use BLAKE2b-512 with an
8-byte little-endian type-URL length, the type URL and encoded effecting data.
The [transaction body](../crates/core/transaction/src/transaction.rs) combines
parameter, memo and fee-funding hashes, the explicit nullifier window, the action
count and ordered action hashes. SpendAuth signatures bind these intended effects;
the Binding signature covers the complete body’s auth hash. Balance commitments,
including private fee funding, must sum to zero. Frozen signing vectors live in
[transaction tests](../crates/core/transaction/tests).

Supported user action families are defined by [Action](../crates/core/transaction/src/action.rs).
Transfer binds its receiver ciphertext, metadata, owner accumulator payload and
proof context. NoteReshape preserves sender ownership and regulated Active status.
Withdrawals bind the complete destination and withdrawn value. AggregateBundle
is an internal action and is rejected in user-submitted transactions.

Host deposits, registrations, status changes and seizure use canonical host
source locations and replay-protected receipts. Bankd supplies their authorization;
Shieldd validates the state/proof prerequisites. [HostExecution](../crates/core/app/src/app/host.rs)
defines legal lifecycle transitions and exact source/digest encoding.

## Withdrawals and proof systems

`ShieldedHostWithdrawal` is the withdrawal action. Its `HostWithdrawal` carries
an asset, amount, and either a transfer recipient or host execution calls.
Bankd settles the resulting host effects and owns all IBC execution.
`ShieldedWithdrawalProof` binds the host destination effect hash, value and
compliance facts; the canonical proof family is `shielded_withdrawal`.

[Gnark circuits](../tools/gnark/internal/circuits) and Rust public-input projection
must agree on fields, canonical encodings, hash domains, dummy branches and
statement ordering. Exact relation coverage is in the
[Transfer](transfer-circuit/constraint-checklist.md) and
[compliance](compliance/constraint-checklist.md) checklists. Proof metadata and
staged manifests bind exact artifacts. Setup changes require fresh proof checks
and coordinated deployment of verifiers and proving clients.

[SnarkPack](snarkpack/design.md) retains full-target v1 and torus v2 encodings
with the existing transcript, statement and SRS semantics. Independent reference,
interoperability and fuzz tests remain verification roots. External
[Shieldd Security](https://github.com/mizufinance/shieldd-security) owns formal
specifications and certification evidence for exact commits.
