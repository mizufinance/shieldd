# SnarkPack Filecoin-to-Penumbra Adaptation Register

Status: open coverage artifact. This document records intentional differences
between Filecoin SnarkPack v2 and Penumbra's local SnarkPack/RIPP backend.

Filecoin v2 is used as the reference for Fiat-Shamir omission/reordering bug
classes and transcript discipline. Penumbra's local spec remains authoritative
for BLS12-377, statement binding, padding, SRS/VK binding, and aggregate-bundle
integration. No cross-curve byte-level equivalence to Filecoin is claimed.

Every non-comment row in
`crates/crypto/proof-aggregation/formal/snarkpack/adaptation-scope.txt` must
appear exactly once in the table below.

No `filecoin-shape` row can leave `open` until `filecoin.normative-pin` is
reviewed. The normative SnarkPack-shape source is Bellperson `v0.21.0`;
rust-fil-proofs `filecoin-proofs-v11.1.0` is production-consumer evidence that
this Bellperson version shipped through Filecoin Network v16 Skyr. Older
Bellperson pins are historical comparison aids only.

Comparison levels:

- `penumbra-byte`: exact Penumbra bytes must match between Penumbra reference
  and optimized paths.
- `abstract-trace`: typed event order, dependencies, and equation roles must
  match the Penumbra spec.
- `filecoin-shape`: abstract dependency shape is compared against Filecoin v2
  bug classes only.
- `penumbra-local`: Penumbra-only integration behavior with no Filecoin
  equivalent.
- `assumption`: accepted dependency, tracked through the assumption register.

Deviation classes:

- `mechanical`: naming, type shape, plumbing, or equivalent representation.
- `performance`: same semantics, different execution strategy.
- `security-binding`: transcript, statement, SRS, VK, domain, hash, or
  public-input binding.
- `semantic`: may change accepted/rejected proofs or verifier equations.

Tests are evidence, not proof or review. A `security-binding` or `semantic`
adaptation cannot leave `open` solely because tests pass.

## Scope Derivation

The adaptation scope is based on a grep pass over these families:

- curve/backend identifiers: `Bls12_377`, `decaf377`, `Fq`, pairing aliases
- hash/transcript calls: `Sha256`, `Digest`, challenge helpers, statement digest
  helpers, family transcript domains
- serialization: `serialize_compressed`, `deserialize_compressed`, canonical
  serialization/deserialization traits
- SRS/VK references: `SRS`, `DevSrs`, `srs_id`, `PreparedVerifyingKey`,
  `vk_digest`, verifier-key digest helpers
- public input and padding paths
- aggregate proof wrapper and app-level aggregate bundle routing

The invariant script checks that every scoped touch point maps to exactly one
register row and that every register row is scoped.
