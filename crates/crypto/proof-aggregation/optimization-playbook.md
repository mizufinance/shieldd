# SnarkPack Optimization Playbook

How to find, judge, implement, and land optimizations of the Shieldd-owned
RIPP backend without changing protocol bytes silently, without shipping
microbench fiction, and without paying complexity that the measured benefit
does not justify.

This is the durable process behind `docs/snarkpack/verification.md` (X3). Every optimization
follows it.

## 0. The one rule: optimize in category 1 or 2, never 3

| Category | Touches bytes? | What it is | How to land |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — internal compute** | No, by construction | Same group elements / field values, faster math | Default. Byte/trace baselines pass unchanged. |
| **2 — output/wire encoding** | Yes (wire bytes only) | Same transcript + elements, different serialization | Version-bump path (§5). |
| **3 — transcript / Fiat-Shamir input** | Yes (transcript bytes) | A *protocol* change, not an optimization | **Forbidden through this loop.** |

A category-1 optimization computes the identical element, so the on-the-wire
aggregate bytes and the ShielddByte transcript are unchanged — the golden
baselines pass without anyone thinking about it, and `AGGREGATE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
stays put.

**Byte-stability is necessary, not always sufficient.** A passing byte/trace
baseline proves you did not change the *output*, but it cannot vouch for a change
that weakens a *validation or soundness check* (e.g. batched vs per-element
subgroup checks — §8 candidate 1). Such a change can be byte-stable and still
accept invalid proofs; the gates won't catch it. Any change to how elements are
*validated* needs an explicit security review on top of byte stability.

Category 3 changes what gets hashed for challenges. That voids the existing
transcript evidence — the argument *"our transcript is byte-shaped like the
audited Filecoin/Bellperson SnarkPack, therefore their soundness analysis applies
to us"* — and would require re-establishing the evidence plus the F\* boundary.
It is not an optimization.
**Do not do category 3 under the guise of speed.** The byte/trace baselines make
it impossible to land silently: it shows up as a transcript-byte diff that fails
the gate.

Transcript surface to never touch as an "optimization":
- `encode_statement` — `crates/crypto/proof-aggregation/src/statement.rs`
- `ChallengeContext` / `challenge_preimage` — `crates/crypto/proof-aggregation/src/ipp/ip_proofs/src/challenge.rs`
- family transcript digests — `crates/crypto/proof-aggregation/src/transcript.rs`

## 0.5 Dynamic-core scaling (hard rule)

Parallelism is encouraged and should *maximize* the cores it is given, but it
must **scale dynamically** with the runtime core count. Never assume or hardcode
a static number of cores, a fixed split, or a machine-specific constant.

Production will run a large, not-yet-fixed core count across many machines, and
the natural parallelism unit is also *across aggregations*. So an intra-op
parallel construct must degrade gracefully — never slower than serial — when
cores are scarce or already busy with other aggregations. `rayon` work-stealing
satisfies this by construction; bespoke fixed-thread schemes do not.

## 0.6 Tunable Parameters Register

Any constant that will need calibration once the production machine architecture
is settled — a parallel-vs-serial `n` threshold, chunk size, `rayon::join`
nesting depth, pool size — must be a **named tunable** recorded here, never a
silent magic number on a parallel path.

| Name | Site | Current value | Rationale | Tune when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(none yet — populate as parallel knobs are introduced or surfaced)_ | | | | hardware known |

## 0.7 Parallelization is deferred, not optimized

The current default parallelization stays as-is. **Do not tune it now.** The
allocation strategy — how a fixed core pool is spent — is settled *later*,
against the benchmark matrix (§10), once the production architecture is known.
The matrix must cover three regimes:

- **Throughput** — many aggregations in parallel, each lean (≈1 thread); cores
  saturated by the workload, so intra-op `rayon` yields ~nothing.
- **Latency** — one aggregation across many cores (intra-op `rayon`); the regime
  the current landed parallel stack was benched in.
- **Hybrid** — bounded intra-op parallelism plus across-aggregation scheduling.

Until then, the value of every intra-op `rayon` change is *regime-conditional and
unsettled*: it is **not** counted toward the optimization bar (§4). That bar is
about work reduction, measured at the work floor (§3).

## 1. FIND — where to look

Two complementary methods; use both.

### 1a. Profiler-driven (top-down)
The build and verify paths are already instrumented. Read the sub-timings and
attack the largest *measured* stage, not the most obvious one.

- `AggregateVerificationProfile` — `backend.rs` (verify path): `deserialize_ms`,
  `challenge_ms`, `tipp_mipp_ms`, `public_input_fold_ms`, `ppe_ms`,
  `core_total_ms`.
- `AggregateBuildBackendProfile` — `backend.rs` (build path): per-stage
  `backend_*_ms` fields, including the pairing breakdown
  (`backend_pairing_miller_loop_ms`, `backend_pairing_final_exponentiation_ms`)
  and the per-round GIPA/TIPA/KZG sub-timings.

Pairing cost (Miller loop + final exponentiation) usually dominates verify, so a
multi-pairing **merge** that removes a final-exponentiation beats a scalar-mul
tweak that the profiler can barely see.

### 1b. Pattern-driven (bottom-up)
Grep the RIPP backend (`backend.rs`, `src/ipp/ip_proofs/src/`,
`src/ipp/dh_commitments/src/`) for the recurring category-1 smells:

| Smell | Faster form |
|---|---|
| sequential `fold` / `mul_helper` scalar-mul-then-add over a vector | variable-base MSM (`G::msm`) |
| `.map(\|x\| x.inverse().unwrap())` over a vector | `ark_ff::batch_inversion` |
| N independent `cfg_multi_pairing` checks | one combined multi-pairing (random linear combination) — removes a final-exponentiation |
| `.clone()` on `PairingOutput` / `G1` / `G2` inside a per-round loop | in-place `add_assign` / `mul_assign` |
| challenge powers / inverses recomputed across passes | hoist + reuse |
| leftover `//TODO: Optimization` / `VariableMSM` markers | the marked optimization |

## 2. CLASSIFY — record the category before coding

- Alters any byte that feeds a challenge hash? → **category 3, stop.**
- Changes the serialized aggregate-proof encoding? → **category 2** (§5).
- Same elements, faster compute? → **category 1** (§4; most optimizations).

If unsure between 1 and 3, the test is mechanical: implement, run the byte +
trace baselines. Pass unchanged ⇒ category 1. Fail ⇒ you changed bytes; decide
wire-only (2) vs transcript (3) and act accordingly.

## 3. MEASURE — prove the win is real

Never quote an isolated microbench as an end-to-end result: a large microbench
speedup routinely collapses into the noise band once measured on the full
aggregate/verify path at realistic batch sizes.

### 3a. Corpus-backed bench
`crates/bench/benches/vanilla/snarkpack.rs` benchmarks `aggregate_family` and
`verify_family_aggregate` by `(family, count)`. The Groth16 proof corpus lives
under `crates/bench/corpus/snarkpack/`; the bench loads it via
`load_or_generate_items`, regenerating from a fixed `ChaCha20Rng` seed only when a
file is absent, so the measured closure times only the aggregate/verify call. The
small fixtures (≤64) are committed for fast CI; the large ones (1024, 2048) are
git-ignored and regenerate on first use (deterministic, so A/B-stable).

### 3b. The compile-time A/B seam
To compare an optimization against its pre-optimization form on the *real*
end-to-end path in the *same release build*, use the `bench-baseline` feature
(compile-time, never a runtime env branch, never on a transcript path):

1. At the optimized call site, gate between the optimized impl and a retained
   `*_baseline` impl with `#[cfg(feature = "bench-baseline")]` (worked example:
   `_compute_final_commitment_keys` / `fold_keys_baseline` in
   `src/ipp/ip_proofs/src/gipa.rs`).
2. Build and run the bench twice and compare medians:

   ```sh
   # optimized (default)
   cargo build --release -p shieldd-sdk-bench --bench snarkpack
   ./target/release/deps/snarkpack-* --bench --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 4 "snarkpack verify"

   # pre-optimization baseline
   cargo build --release -p shieldd-sdk-bench --bench snarkpack \
     --features shieldd-sdk-proof-aggregation/bench-baseline
   SNARKPACK... ./target/release/deps/snarkpack-* --bench ... "snarkpack verify"
   ```

   (First ever run populates the corpus; pass the criterion `--bench` flag so it
   measures rather than runs in test mode.)
3. Report medians at realistic counts (n ∈ {1,2,4,8,64}). Flag anything inside
   the noise band as noise.

The retained `*_baseline` fn doubles as the equivalence-test oracle (§4), so the
seam and the correctness proof share one artifact.

### 3c. The work floor is the per-change metric
Run the A/B at `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` as well. This is the **work floor** — it
strips scheduling out and shows whether the change removed real work. A
work-reduction optimization must move the work-floor number; a change whose only
gain appears at >1 thread is *parallelization*, which is deferred to the §10
matrix and is **not** quoted as an optimization win (§0.7).

### 3d. Report the cumulative number, not just the per-change delta
The §3b seam compares against the *immediately preceding* state, which is itself
already optimized — a moving reference. Per-change deltas measured this way do
**not** sum to the real total (§4.5). For any landed change, also record the
**cumulative A/B**: full optimized build vs the pristine *origin* baseline. The
cumulative-vs-origin figure is the headline number.

## 4. DECIDE — the win-or-clarity bar

Land iff **either**:
- a **measured end-to-end gain above the noise floor** at realistic batch sizes, **or**
- a **clear correctness / clarity / scaling improvement that is provably never
  slower** (equivalence-tested, strictly better asymptotically, expresses intent
  more directly).

**Reject** changes that add non-trivial API surface or indirection for a
near-noise gain with no clarity or scaling case. "Technically faster in a
microbench" is not sufficient. Honest reporting includes "this was noise,
reverting."

### 4a. The 10% rule — estimate before attempting
Do **not** *attempt* an optimization you estimate below **10%** end-to-end at
realistic counts. Estimate first — FE/Miller-loop accounting or op-count
arithmetic is usually enough — and record the estimate before coding. Pursue only
≥10% candidates. A smaller *measured* result is fine to keep if it lands; a
smaller *estimate* is the reason not to start. Pure correctness/clarity/scaling
refactors are still allowed but are labeled as such, not as performance.

## 4.5 Interactions — optimizations against one another

Two optimizations can work against each other:

- **Site conflict.** Two rewrites of the same loop (e.g. parallelize vs MSM-ify)
  are mutually exclusive — implementing one removes the other's premise, and the
  §3b seam can only gate one at a time. A/B them independently, then pick one.
- **Non-additive stacking.** Stacked parallelism shares one thread pool, so
  per-change deltas measured against a moving reference do **not** sum: the
  cumulative win is not the sum of the per-commit figures, and can be far less
  under a core-saturated workload. For any stack of ≥2 related changes, record a
  final cumulative A/B (§3d). A parallel stack must never claim the sum of its
  per-commit numbers as its real win.

## 5. IMPLEMENT — per-category workflow

### Category 1
1. Keep the pre-optimization implementation as a named `*_baseline` reference.
2. Add a unit equivalence test (`optimized == baseline`) at sizes covering
   **every** code path the optimization touches (cf. the both-sided
   `msm_keys_equals_sequential_fold` in `dh_commitments/src/afgho16/mod.rs`).
3. Wire the §3b A/B seam.
4. Implement; confirm the byte + trace baselines pass **unchanged** and the
   version stays 1.
5. **Baseline lifecycle.** Once landed and validated, the optimized code *is* the
   live baseline going forward — the retained `*_baseline` is only a frozen A/B +
   equivalence artifact, compiled solely under `bench-baseline`. Remove the
   `*_baseline` twin unless it remains a useful equivalence oracle; do not hoard
   dead feature-gated paths. Distinguish the *origin baseline* (pristine,
   pre-optimization) from the *prior-stack reference* (the per-change A/B point):
   the headline number is always vs origin (§3d).

### Category 2 (wire encoding only)
1. Bump `AGGREGATE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (`statement.rs`).
2. Regenerate both golden baselines via the `--ignored` helpers:
   - `cargo test -p shieldd-sdk-proof-aggregation regenerate_aggregate_byte_baseline -- --ignored`
   - `cargo test -p shieldd-sdk-proof-aggregation-reference regenerate_shieldd_byte_trace_baseline -- --ignored`
3. Record the protocol-version decision in the formal handoff. The invariants
   script enforces the remaining formal-handoff discipline.

## 6. VALIDATE — the gate set (all green before done)

- `cargo test -p shieldd-sdk-proof-aggregation --lib` — byte baseline,
  determinism (`aggregation_is_deterministic_for_fixed_inputs`), Groth16 oracle
  agreement (`snarkpack_matches_single_and_batch_groth16_oracles`).
- `cargo test -p shieldd-sdk-proof-aggregation-reference --lib` — trace
  baseline, trace equivalence
  (`production_and_reference_traces_match_declared_levels`), input + verifier
  mutation matrices (`*_mutant_matrix_is_declared_per_byte_binding_row`,
  `mutation_matrices_cover_shieldd_byte_trace_rows`).
- `just snarkpack-fuzz-smoke` — 6 targets, zero crashes.
- `just snarkpack-invariants`,
  `just snarkpack-formal` — no regression.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- A/B delta recorded in the commit/PR description (not a committed threshold —
  fixed perf thresholds and the DoS gate are a later stage).

## 7. LAND OR REVERT

- Category 1, baselines hold, win-or-clarity bar met → land.
- Measured gain is noise and no clarity/scaling case → revert, and say so.
- Baselines moved unexpectedly → it was not the category you thought; stop and
  re-classify before doing anything else.

## 8. Candidate backlog (ranked, grounded in real sites)

Each is a *candidate*, not a commitment — each goes through §3–§4 first, including
the §4a 10% estimate.

**Open, clears the 10% bar — deferred pending a security review (not started):**

1. **Batched GT subgroup validation on deserialization.** The measured #1 verify
   hotspot is `deserialize_ms`, **not** pairings. `AggregateProof`
   (`groth16_aggregation.rs`) carries many GT elements — the four top-level
   (`com_a/b/c`, `ip_ab`) plus the combined `tipp_mipp_proof`
   `r_commitment_steps`, where each round carries both AB and C commitments.
   `deserialize_aggregate_proof` (`backend.rs`) calls
   `deserialize_compressed` (Arkworks `Validate::Yes`), which runs a **full
   GT-subgroup exponentiation per element** — the dominant cost. Replace it with
   decode-`Validate::No` + **one randomized batch subgroup check** over all GT
   elements (random rᵢ, test `Π eᵢ^{rᵢ}` is in 𝔾_T; in-subgroup-iff-all w.h.p.),
   paying 1 exponentiation instead of N. Byte-stable (category 1 in bytes —
   validation is orthogonal to the wire/transcript). Only the subgroup-check part
   of `deserialize_ms` batches; the Fp12 decompression/parsing remainder does not,
   and 128-bit verifier-local randomizers cap the batchable speedup at ~2×, so the
   estimate clears the 10% bar at the low end rather than dramatically. Confirm the
   exact GT-element count and the decompression share before committing.

   **Why it is gated, not just landed.** This weakens a *soundness check*
   (per-element → aggregate-probabilistic), so byte-stability is **necessary but
   not sufficient** — it needs an explicit security review. The review must
   establish, before any code lands:
   - **The error bound from the real BLS12-377 𝔽_{q^12}^× order factorization**
     — the smallest cofactor prime ℓ_min sets the per-round soundness error 1/ℓ_min.
     If ℓ_min is small, one batch round is insufficient (need larger randomizers /
     multiple rounds / per-prime handling). *Compute this number first; it gates
     the whole design.* Analyze the **smallest** N (n=1/2), not the typical n=64.
   - **Randomizer sizing & domain** — error ≤ 2⁻¹²⁸ derived per cofactor prime,
     not assumed from "a random 𝔽_r scalar"; CSPRNG, fresh per verification.
   - **Independence** — rᵢ sampled after the proof bytes are fixed, never derived
     from the proof/transcript (else the prover can grind; also would be a
     forbidden category-3 touch). Assert rᵢ never enter `encode_statement`/
     `challenge_preimage`.
   - **Completeness** — every GT element the per-element path validated is in the
     batch; derive the list from the serialization traversal so a future field
     can't silently escape it. Non-GT fields (`agg_c` in G1, any G2) keep their
     own subgroup checks.
   - **Negative tests are the real proof** — plant a small-cofactor-torsion
     component in *each* element position (top-level and a round commitment in each
     sub-proof) and assert the batch **rejects** every one. If you can't construct
     that test, the cofactor structure isn't understood well enough to ship.
   - **Filecoin-shape interaction** — confirm the audited construction's
     "deserialized elements are subgroup-valid" premise is still discharged, now by
     the batch.

**Added by the 2026-07-07 deep audit (each still goes through §3–§4):**

2. **Defer the GIPA commitment folds into one GT multi-exponentiation.**
   `_compute_recursive_challenges` (gipa.rs:657) interleaves challenge hashing
   with `fold_output` — 2 GT exponentiations × 3 commitments × log₂n rounds,
   each a standalone 128-bit square-and-multiply. The challenge for round i
   hashes only the previous challenge and that round's `com_1`/`com_2`
   (gipa.rs:672–679), **never the running folded com** — so the folds are
   deferrable: run the hash loop first, then compute each final com as one
   multi-exp over 2·log₂n GT bases (Straus, shared cyclotomic squarings).
   Saves ~(2·log₂n − 1) × 128 GT squarings per commitment (×3, ×2 for the
   combined TIPP/MIPP transcript). Category 1 (identical GT values, transcript
   untouched — the trace baseline proves it). Verify `challenge_ms`/
   `tipp_mipp_ms` share first; below the 10% bar at small n, real at n ≥ 256.

3. **Confirm GT exponentiation uses cyclotomic squaring throughout.**
   `mul_helper` on `PairingOutput` routes through arkworks' `Group` impl,
   whose `double()` is `cyclotomic_square` — good. But any site exponentiating
   a raw `Fp12` (not `PairingOutput`) pays generic `square()`, ~2× slower.
   One-line audit: grep for `pow(` / `mul_assign` on `Fp12`-typed values
   outside `PairingOutput`. Zero-risk category 1 if any site is found.

4. **Category 2 (parked): cyclotomic/torus GT compression on the wire.**
   The aggregate proof is dominated by GT elements (~576 bytes each
   uncompressed Fp12); Karabina/torus compression halves them and shrinks the
   deserialize hotspot's parsing share. Wire-encoding only (category 2,
   version bump + baseline regen). Interacts with candidate 1: decompression
   cost partially offsets the subgroup-check saving — evaluate them together,
   not separately.

5. **Cross-family batch verification (amortization lens, 2026-07-07).** The
   chain verifies up to 7 family aggregates per block as independent
   `verify_family_aggregate` calls, each paying its own PPE final
   exponentiation and KZG multi-pairings. Verifier-local random combiners
   r₁…r₇ (fresh, post-deserialization, never transcript-derived) can merge
   the 7 PPE checks — distinct prepared VKs are fine, Miller loops just
   concatenate — into one multi-pairing with a **single** final
   exponentiation, and likewise the 14 KZG opening checks. Saves ~6 final
   exps + final-exp-per-KZG-pair per block; fixed-cost stage, so it matters
   most at small n where per-aggregate overhead dominates. Batching changes
   accept/reject *granularity* (one bit for the whole block — on failure,
   fall back to per-family to attribute blame), and it is a
   validation-strength change like candidate 1: byte-stable but needs the
   same security-review checklist (randomizer sizing per cofactor prime,
   independence from proof bytes, negative tests planting a bad element in
   each family slot). Lives *above* this crate's per-aggregate API — the
   batching seam belongs in the caller that sees all 7 families.

6. **Padding-aware commitment coalescing (prover, 2026-07-07).** Padding
   repeats the final row to the next power of two
   (`pad_items_to_power_of_two`, padding.rs) — at n = 2^k + 1 nearly half the
   commit work runs over *identical* elements. Pairing commitments collapse
   algebraically: Π e(A, vᵢ) over the duplicated tail = e(A, Σ vᵢ), trading
   up-to-half the Miller loops for cheap G2 adds of SRS keys (likewise
   repeated-base MSM terms: sum the scalars). The commitment *values* are
   bit-identical, so transcript and wire bytes are untouched — category 1,
   provable by the byte baseline at a padded count. Win is shape-dependent
   (zero at exact powers of two); measure against the real family-count
   distribution before building. GIPA's fold rounds don't preserve the
   duplication past round one, so only the initial commit stage coalesces.

7. **Per-proof final-exp fusion inside one verify (verifier, 2026-07-07).**
   Within a single `verify_family_aggregate`, the two KZG opening checks
   (`verify_commitment_key_g2/g1_kzg_opening`, tipa/mod.rs:1137/1160) and the
   base-commitment + PPE checks each pay their own final exponentiation on a
   2–4-pair multi-pairing. All are of the form `multi_pairing(...) == 0`, so
   the same verifier-local-randomizer argument as candidate 5 fuses them
   into one Miller-loop concatenation + one final exp *per proof* — the
   intra-proof version of candidate 5, worth doing first since it needs no
   cross-crate seam. Note the KZG pair inputs are challenge-dependent, so
   prepared-point caching does not apply here (the fixed-SRS prepared trick
   is already spent on the PPE, §11); the fusion is the whole remaining win.
   Same security-review checklist as candidates 1/5. Also confirmed while
   sweeping: `deserialize_aggregate_proof` uses `deserialize_compressed`
   (full per-point subgroup validation) — that cost is exactly what
   candidate 1's batched subgroup check targets; no separate finding.

**Lineage cross-check (2026-07-07):** against bellperson/Filecoin SnarkPack
and the SnarkPack v2 paper, this backend already has every headline verifier
trick: merged TIPP/MIPP transcript (single `r_commitment_steps`), O(log n)
final-ck verification via KZG openings (`verify_commitment_key_*_kzg_opening`
— the O(n) `_compute_final_commitment_keys` MSM is not on the production
verify path), 128-bit rescaled challenges (`c`/`c_inv` swap, gipa.rs:694),
prepared-G2 PPE reuse (§11), MSM final-key recombination (§9). The genuinely
open deltas are candidates 1–7 above plus the §10 fixed-base SRS tables.

**Deferred to the §10 benchmark matrix (not pursued as optimizations here):**

- *Large fixed-base MSM tables for the SRS generators* (windowed comb/Pippenger,
  tens–hundreds of MB). Payoff is memory-bandwidth- and regime-bound and does not
  transfer from a developer machine to the production fleet — see §10a.

**Already evaluated — do not re-attempt without new evidence:**

- Batch all verify pairing checks into one randomized multi-pairing (fold the KZG
  openings, TIPA-AB/C base cases, and the 3-pair PPE) — pairings are not the
  bottleneck (deserialize is, candidate 1); regressed or tied on our shapes, in
  line with the SnarkPack literature. The narrow 2-KZG-opening merge is a subset.
- Batch-invert the transcript — log₂n (≤13) elements; negligible vs pairings.
- MSM-ify `fold_public_inputs` `g_ic` / the shifted-`ck_1` build — one-time, sized
  by public inputs not by n; below bar.
- Category-2 uncompressed encoding (slower); reusing prepared `ck_a` in TIPA-AB
  (regressed the build path).

Architectural TODOs (`tipa/mod.rs`, `structured_scalar_message.rs`) are
out-of-loop refactors, not optimization candidates.

## 9. Optimizations currently in place

Two work-reduction optimizations are live on the default build, both category 1
(identical elements, byte/trace baselines unchanged, version 1):

- **Final commitment-key recombination via MSM.** `_compute_final_commitment_keys`
  recombines the final GIPA keys (`Σ xᵢ·ck[i]`) with the commitment trait's
  `msm_keys` (variable-base MSM) instead of a sequential fold. Equivalence:
  `msm_keys_equals_sequential_fold` (both key sides); A/B seam `fold_keys_baseline`.
- **Prepared verifier-G2 reuse in the PPE (§11).** `verify_ppe` reuses the
  precomputes carried in `ark_groth16::PreparedVerifyingKey` (`alpha_g1_beta_g2` as
  a GT exponentiation, the prepared `-γ`/`-δ` tables) instead of re-pairing the raw
  `vk` G2 points, removing one Miller loop and three `G2Prepared::from` builds.
  Equivalence: `ppe_optimized_matches_baseline_gt_value`.

Both clear §4's never-slower clause (provable work reduction, equivalence-tested)
rather than the §4a 10% bar; each retains a `*_baseline` twin under `bench-baseline`
as the A/B and equivalence oracle.

A `rayon` parallel stack (GIPA rescale folds, round commits, TIPA proofs,
verification checks, KZG checks) is also in place as the default. It is **not**
tuned here — its value is regime-conditional and settled later against the §10
matrix (§0.7).

## 10. Parallelization benchmark matrix (to run later)

Parallelization is *not* tuned through the optimization loop (§0.7). Instead,
once the production machine architecture is settled, run this matrix to choose
the default allocation strategy. Do not change parallelization code before then;
only populate the §0.6 register with the knobs the matrix will sweep.

Axes:

- **Regime:** throughput (N aggregations × 1 thread) vs latency (1 aggregation ×
  M threads) vs hybrid (bounded intra-op + across-aggregation scheduling).
- **Core pool:** sweep available-core counts (e.g. 1, 4, 16, 64, 256) — never a
  static assumption.
- **`n` (proofs per aggregation):** {1, 2, 4, 8, 64}.
- **Intra-op knob:** rayon pool size / max-intra-op-threads, off → full.

Metric: aggregate **throughput** (aggs/sec) *and* per-aggregation **latency**
under a *saturated* workload — not idle-bench wall-clock, which flatters intra-op
parallelism by assuming free spare cores. Output: a recommended default (regime +
knob values) per candidate architecture, with the §0.6 register filled in.

### 10a. Big memory budget — MUST be tested once the architecture is known

A *memory budget* is a fixed, declared RAM cap a precomputation cache is allowed
to consume in exchange for cutting repeated compute: you set the ceiling up front
and size the lookup tables to fit under it. For the SRS this means windowed
fixed-base tables (comb/Pippenger) over the fixed SRS generators, so each
scalar-mul becomes table lookups instead of doublings. Bigger budget → bigger
tables → faster fixed-base MSMs → more RAM per worker.

**This is an open task, not a closed decision.** The large-table version is *not*
benchmarked yet and must not be sized or committed on developer-machine numbers,
because its payoff does not transfer:

- **Memory-bandwidth bound.** Tables trade arithmetic for memory lookups; whether
  that wins depends on the machine's memory bandwidth and cache hierarchy relative
  to its multiplier throughput. The *sign* of the result can flip between a laptop
  (fat caches, high unified-memory bandwidth) and a many-core server (many threads
  contending for shared DRAM) — not just the magnitude.
- **Regime-entangled (ties into §0.7/§10).** Tables cost RAM *per concurrent
  worker*. In the **throughput** regime you either replicate them per worker (RAM
  blows up — the budget genuinely binds) or share and serialize access (the
  speedup evaporates). The budget cannot be chosen before the regime is, and the
  regime is settled here, in the §10 matrix.
- **Saturated, not idle.** The marginal MSM speedup must be measured under a
  saturated workload; an idle laptop bench overstates it.

**Action when production hardware is settled:** add the large fixed-base table to
the §10 matrix as an extra axis — **memory budget** {0 (off), small, large}, swept
against the regime × core-pool × `n` axes, measured under saturated load — and
emit a recommended budget per candidate architecture. Until then this stays
unbenched and uncommitted by design. (Record the chosen budget and table sizing in
the §0.6 register once known.)

## 11. How `verify_ppe` works today

The fixed verifier G2 points the PPE pairs against never change across
verifications, so `verify_ppe` reuses the precomputes **already carried in
`ark_groth16::PreparedVerifyingKey`** rather than re-preparing and re-pairing the
raw `vk` G2 points each call:

- `e(α·r_sum, β) = e(α, β)^{r_sum}` — `pvk.alpha_g1_beta_g2` raised to `r_sum`, a
  GT exponentiation in place of one Miller loop.
- `e(g_ic, γ) = e(-g_ic, -γ)` and `e(agg_c, δ) = e(-agg_c, -δ)` — paired against
  `pvk.{gamma,delta}_g2_neg_pc`, the already-prepared `-γ`/`-δ` line tables, so
  neither γ nor δ is re-prepared and β is not prepared at all.

Net per verify: −1 Miller loop, −3 `G2Prepared::from` builds, +1 GT exponentiation
(cheaper than a Miller loop). Strictly less work for the identical GT element, so
it is never slower than the three-pairing form. The PPE is a fixed-cost stage
(independent of n), so the saving is near-constant in absolute terms.

**Category 1, byte- and trace-stable.** Verifier-side arithmetic only: same
accept/reject decision, no wire or Fiat-Shamir byte touched, version unchanged. The
reference oracle has its own `verify_ppe` and the PPE emits no challenge-trace
events, so the ShielddByte trace baseline is unaffected. Equivalence is asserted by
`ppe_optimized_matches_baseline_gt_value` (the optimized expression equals the
three-pairing GT value over random inputs); end-to-end correctness is additionally
gated by `snarkpack_matches_single_and_batch_groth16_oracles` and the byte/trace
baselines. The three-pairing form is retained as `verify_ppe_baseline` (compiled
only under `bench-baseline`) for the §3b A/B seam.

`crates/bench/benches/vanilla/snarkpack_prepared_g2.rs` measures per-`G2Prepared::from`
cost against full verify, bounding the prepare-reuse portion of the saving.
