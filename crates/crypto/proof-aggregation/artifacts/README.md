# Production SnarkPack SRS

This directory intentionally contains no SRS artifact.

Production aggregation and verification fail closed until an identified
ceremony owner supplies:

- a BLS12-377 setup transcript with an independently reviewed verification
  procedure and evidence that neither KZG trapdoor is known;
- one canonical compressed `ark_ip_proofs::tipa::SRS<Bls12_377>` containing
  exactly `2 * 32768 - 1` nonzero powers in each group;
- the artifact SHA-256 digest and the domain-separated SRS identifier; and
- the artifact filename and active identifier for the compile-time registry in
  `src/srs.rs`.

Registration must include the artifact, transcript, verification evidence, and
source digests. Formal evidence is maintained in `mizufinance/shieldd-formal`.

Deployments may set `SHIELDD_SNARKPACK_SRS_ARTIFACT_DIR` to an absolute
distribution directory. The runtime still accepts only the filename, artifact
digest, SRS identifier, dimensions, canonical encoding, and subgroup-valid
points pinned by the compiled registry. Configuration cannot register new
bytes.

The first load result is cached for the process lifetime. Artifact changes
require a restart.
