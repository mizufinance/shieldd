# SnarkPack Fuzz Corpus Baseline

Status: committed minimized corpus baseline.

Date: 2026-06-01
Host: local macOS arm64 developer runner with `cargo +nightly fuzz`.
Scope: `crates/crypto/proof-aggregation-fuzz`.

The smoke gate copies the committed corpus into a temporary directory before
execution, so CI smoke runs seed from it without mutating it. Only the small,
curated, human-named seeds (`empty`, `oversize`, `valid-wrapper`, `wrong-digest`,
…) are committed; the bulk SHA1-named machine-minimized corpus is git-ignored
(`crates/crypto/proof-aggregation-fuzz/.gitignore`) and lives under the local
working tree only — it bloats the repo and regenerates every run. The figures
below describe the local coverage-guided sessions, time-boxed at 61 seconds per
target, run well beyond the 16-run smoke default.

The Lean differential conformance layer is **not** a fuzz target. The transcript-
shape domain is finite (one shape per power of two up to the SRS max), so it is
exhaustively enumerated by `proof-aggregation-lean-conformance`, not sampled —
see `docs/snarkpack/verification.md` (TXN-I5). The `feature/coverage` columns below describe
machine-fuzzed byte boundaries only.

## Minimized Corpora

| target | committed corpus | minimized features | coverage edges | bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `wrapper_inner_range` | 9 files | 52 | 52 | 388 |
| `preflight_aggregate_verify` | 3 files | 7,048 | 6,867 | 151 |
| `deserialize_aggregate_proof` | 56 files | 449 | 208 | 23,495 |

## Clean Baseline Runs

| target | clean duration | runs | final coverage | final features | result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `wrapper_inner_range` | 61s (0.017h) | 1,084,302 | 41 | 41 | clean |
| `preflight_aggregate_verify` | 61s (0.017h) | 657,865 | 299 | 288 | clean |
| `deserialize_aggregate_proof` | 61s (0.017h) | 151,302 | 197 | 438 | clean |

No crash, hang, OOM, panic, or sanitizer finding remains in the recorded clean
baseline. Larger raw corpora and logs are intentionally left under `target/`.
