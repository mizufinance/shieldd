# gnark Proof Runtime

This directory contains the gnark proving runtime for Shieldd's supported
shielded proof families:

- `Transfer`
- `NoteReshape` (`2→1`, `1→8`, `8→1`, and `4→1`)
- `ShieldedIcs20Withdrawal`

Legacy standalone single-leg proving flows are not part of the active surface.

## Current Scope

- proving system: Groth16 over `BLS12-377`
- transports:
  - C-shared libraries for the supported families
  - persistent prover daemon
- artifact model:
  - one canonical artifact set per supported family
  - shared runtime loading and witness/proof ABI handling

## Local Verification

From the repository root, the supported local verification commands are:

```bash
just go-check
just check
just gnark-proof-tests
just gnark-proof-tests-slow
```

`just gnark-proof-tests` is the fast inner-loop suite. Use
`just gnark-proof-tests-slow` for the end-to-end release-mode proof-generation
path.

CI runs the corresponding `ci-*` wrappers under `nix develop`, while local
development can use the plain commands directly.

## Rust Integration Environment

Rust proving selects the gnark backend when the corresponding artifact
directory is configured and one transport is selected for that circuit:

- `SHIELDD_GNARK_TRANSFER_ARTIFACT_DIR`
- `SHIELDD_GNARK_TRANSFER_LIB` or `SHIELDD_GNARK_TRANSFER_DAEMON`
- `SHIELDD_GNARK_NOTE_RESHAPE_ARTIFACT_DIR`
- `SHIELDD_GNARK_NOTE_RESHAPE_LIB` or `SHIELDD_GNARK_NOTE_RESHAPE_DAEMON`
- `SHIELDD_GNARK_SHIELDED_ICS20_WITHDRAWAL_ARTIFACT_DIR`
- `SHIELDD_GNARK_SHIELDED_ICS20_WITHDRAWAL_LIB` or `SHIELDD_GNARK_SHIELDED_ICS20_WITHDRAWAL_DAEMON`

These artifact-directory variables configure prover transports only. Consensus
verification and aggregation always use the verifying keys bundled at build
time; runtime configuration cannot replace them.

The supported families share runtime plumbing, with NoteReshape selected by its
manifest family ID and directional artifact label.

## Rust <-> Gnark Boundary

Each supported family exposes a narrow witness/proof boundary. Witness payloads
are encoded into binary messages, proved in gnark, and decoded back into
Arkworks-compatible proof objects on the Rust side.

Transport selection happens in the Rust gnark client layer:

- bundled shared library
- env-configured shared library
- env-configured daemon

The prover runtime above that transport owns client initialization, caching, and
shutdown. Callers only use the family-specific supported APIs.

## Artifact Model

Each supported family has one canonical bundled artifact set checked into
`tools/gnark/artifacts`. Internal padding and witness-shape details are runtime
concerns, not part of the public product surface.

When a supported circuit changes, regenerate the matching artifacts and then
rebuild and test:

```bash
just go-test
cargo check -p shieldd-sdk-shielded-pool
cargo check -p shieldd-sdk-proof-aggregation
```

The family registries and runtime configuration should be generated from the
supported manifests rather than maintained by ad hoc handwritten wiring.

## Verifier benchmark

The repository includes a host-only verifier benchmark that compares gnark
native verification with Arkworks verification of the exact same gnark-produced
proof through the existing Rust bridge.

The benchmark intentionally separates one-time setup from repeated pure verification:

- gnark:
  - `load_or_decode_ms`
  - `prepare_ms`
  - repeated `verify_*` timings
- Arkworks:
  - `load_or_decode_ms`
  - `translate_ms`
  - `prepare_vk_ms`
  - repeated `verify_*` timings

Run the full comparison from this directory:

```bash
./run-verify-bench.sh
```

Useful variants:

```bash
./run-verify-bench.sh --warmup-iterations 5 --measured-iterations 50
./run-verify-bench.sh --out-dir ../../tmp/gnark/verify-bench-custom
```

The runner ensures artifacts exist for the selected supported circuit, produces
a fresh proof artifact, runs both verifiers, and writes a combined report under
`tmp/gnark/verify-bench/report.json`.

The comparison is host-only. It does not measure proving time and does not include Android runtime overhead.
