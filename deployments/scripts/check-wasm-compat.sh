# break compatibility with downstream web APIs, via the WASM crate.
# Historically, this breakage has taken the form of inadvertently introducing
# dependencies on std, e.g. via `mio`.
#
# More broadly, we want to ensure that monorepo crates with the "component"
# feature build without that (default) feature enabled. Testing this on the wasm
# target will help ensure compat.
